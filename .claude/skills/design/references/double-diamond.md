# Double Diamond Framework

The session flows through four phases, alternating between divergent and convergent thinking:

```

## Phase Details

| Phase | Purpose | Activities | Exit Criteria |
|-------|---------|------------|---------------|
| **DISCOVER** | Explore problem space | Ask about pain, users, impact, constraints | Problem articulated, users identified |
| **DEFINE** | Frame the problem | Problem statement, success criteria, scope, approaches | Statement agreed, approach selected |
| **DEVELOP** | Explore solutions | Architecture, components, data model, user flow | Architecture understood, interfaces defined |
| **DELIVER** | Finalize design | Full research verification, acceptance criteria, risks | Design verified and approved |

## Phase 1: DISCOVER (Diverge)

**Goal:** Explore the problem space broadly before narrowing.

- What problem are we solving?
- Who experiences this problem?
- What's the impact of not solving it?
- What constraints exist?
- What has been tried before?

**Exit:** Problem is clearly articulated and users are identified.

## Phase 2: DEFINE (Converge)

**Goal:** Narrow the problem to an actionable scope.

- Define the problem statement
- Establish success criteria
- Set scope boundaries (what's in/out)
- Propose 2-3 approaches
- Select preferred approach with rationale

**Exit:** Problem statement agreed, approach selected.

## Phase 3: DEVELOP (Diverge)

**Goal:** Explore solution space within the chosen approach.

- Architecture design
- Component breakdown
- Data model (if applicable)
- User flow/interactions
- Integration points

**Verification:** Run research verification before proceeding.

**Exit:** Architecture understood, interfaces defined.

## Phase 4: DELIVER (Converge)

**Goal:** Finalize the design and prepare for implementation.

- Full research verification (mandatory)
- Ensure acceptance criteria are testable
- Document risks and open questions
- Validate design against product.md and tech-stack.md

**Exit:** Design verified and approved.

## Loop-Back Support

User can say "revisit [PHASE]" at any time to return to an earlier phase:

1. Summarize what was established
2. Ask what to reconsider
3. Update subsequent phases if decisions change
