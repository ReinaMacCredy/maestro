# Finish Workflow

> **⚠️ MOVED TO HANDOFF SKILL**
> 
> This workflow has moved to the [handoff skill](../../../handoff/SKILL.md).
> 
> **Triggers:** `ho`, `/conductor-finish`, `/conductor-handoff`
> 
> The handoff skill owns all session cycling and finish workflows, including:
> - `/conductor-finish` - Complete track, extract learnings, archive
> - `/conductor-handoff` - Session cycling (auto-detect create/resume)
> - Pre-finish handoffs and learnings extraction

> 💡 **To access:** Load `handoff` skill, then see `references/workflows/finish.md`
