## Gotchas

- Hard-linked directories (skills/ ↔ .claude/skills/) - updating one updates both, but explicitly delete both
- Thin skill stubs must include keyword-rich descriptions for AI trigger matching
- Delete operations must wait for reference replacements - deleting too early causes broken references
- Relative paths change when files move - `references/X.md` becomes `./X.md` when you're already in references/
- Archive files contain historical references - don't fix them (they're snapshots)
- Party-mode agent paths need updating when workflow moves
- Phase 3 (Knowledge Merge) is required - if it fails, stop workflow
- Phases 1 & 2 are best-effort - failures should log warnings but continue
- Context Refresh (Phase 4) can be skipped with --skip-refresh flag
- User input A/K must be mapped to JSON values "archive"/"keep"
- Atomic writes use $$ (PID) suffix for temp files to prevent collisions
- CODEMAPS loaded at design session start for codebase context
- docs: and chore: commits don't bump version (changelog only)
- Skill versions in SKILL.md frontmatter are manually updated (not automated)
- HALT vs Degrade: `bd` unavailable = HALT; Village unavailable in MA = degrade to SA
- Session lock staleness: heartbeat protocol (5 min updates); stale = >10 min without heartbeat
- Subagent bd access: read-only (show, ready, list); writes return to main agent
- Idempotency: `bd update` and `bd close` are idempotent; `bd create` is NOT
- planTasks mapping: bidirectional - keep planTasks and beadToTask in sync
- Claude Code hooks must exit 0 even on error (try/catch + graceful exit) to avoid crashing Claude
- LEDGER.md in conductor/sessions/active/ is gitignored (personal), archive/*.md is committed (shared)
- Stale ledgers (>24h) are auto-archived on SessionStart to avoid confusion from old context
- FTS5 snippet function: `snippet(handoffs_fts, 2, '>>>', '<<<', '...', 50)` for match highlighting
- artifact-cleanup.py parses dates from filenames (YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-trigger.md), not frontmatter
- Concurrent sessions on same codebase may conflict - documented limitation (last writer wins)
- Amp Code doesn't support hooks - use manual `continuity load/save/handoff` commands
- State machine uses STRICT vs SOFT enforcement - STRICT transitions HALT, SOFT only WARN
- Default branch names differ by repo: check for BOTH `main` AND `master`
- Auto-archive removes A/K prompt entirely - use `--keep` flag to prevent archiving
- Open beads cause HALT at finish unless `--force` is used
- Branch suffix auto-increments (-v2, -v3) if branch already exists
- `workflow.state` for machine logic, `status` field for human readability
- Doc-sync runs as Phase 7 in `/conductor-finish` (after CODEMAPS)
- Doc-sync errors are non-blocking - workflow continues even if doc-sync fails
- Minor doc changes (path renames, function renames) are auto-applied
- Major doc changes (new features, removed features) prompt user
- Track-switch auto-archives LEDGER.md - switching tracks preserves previous session context in archive
- Continuity operations in Conductor are non-blocking - failures log warnings but never halt commands
- bound_track/bound_bead in LEDGER.md frontmatter replace deprecated session-state_*.json files
- Grounding: All sources fail at MANDATORY → block with `MANUAL_VERIFY`, not silent proceed
- Grounding: Timeout → return partial results + warning (soft limits), not hard failure
- Grounding: Subagent timeout → fall back to grounding-only, skip impact scan
- Grounding: Network failure → graceful fallback to repo-only mode
- Grounding: Conflict resolution → auto-prefer highest confidence BUT show conflict summary in output
- Grounding: Implementation order matters → router depends on tiers, enforcement depends on grounding result
- Extraction fidelity: Initial skill extraction may lose philosophical content (e.g., "Why Order Matters"). Fix: copy full SKILL.md first, then split.

## Patterns

- **6-Phase Finish Workflow:** Pre-flight → Thread Compaction → Beads Compaction → Knowledge Merge → Context Refresh → Archive → CODEMAPS
- **Smart Skip:** Each phase checks if work exists before running
- **Resume Capability:** State files track progress for interrupted workflows
- **A/K Archive Choice:** Archive (move to archive/) / Keep (stay active)
- **State Files First:** Create metadata.json with generation and beads sections in Phase 1.3 BEFORE spec/plan generation
- **Collective State Validation:** Treat 3 state files as atomic unit - HAS_STATE = 0 (none), 1 (partial), 2 (all)
- **Double Diamond Phases:** DISCOVER (diverge) → DEFINE (converge) → DEVELOP (diverge) → DELIVER (converge)
- **A/P/C Checkpoints:** At each phase end: [A] Advanced, [P] Party (multi-agent), [C] Continue
- **Unified Track Creation:** /conductor-newtrack includes spec, plan, beads filing, AND review in one flow
- **Conventional Commits Versioning:** feat: → minor, fix: → patch, feat!: → major
- **COMPLEXITY_EXPLAINER:** Score-based design routing (SPEED <4, ASK 4-6, FULL >6)
- **Execution Routing:** TIER 1 (weighted score) + TIER 2 (compound conditions) → SINGLE_AGENT or PARALLEL_DISPATCH
- **RECALL/REMEMBER:** Session lifecycle with anchored format for cross-session context
- **Degradation Signals:** tool_repeat, backtrack, quality_drop, contradiction → 2+ signals triggers compression
- **Anchored Format:** [PRESERVE] markers for Intent and Constraints sections that survive compression
- **Continuity Chain:** `/conductor-implement` (Phase 0.5: load) → work → `/conductor-finish` (Phase 6.5: handoff)
- **State File Consolidation:** Replace N separate state files with sections in a single consolidated file (e.g., metadata.json.beads replaces .fb-progress.json)
- **Track Binding Flow:** null → bound_track → bound_bead → null (lifecycle matches Conductor workflow)
- **Tiered Grounding:** Light (1 source, 3s) → Mini (1-2, 5s) → Standard (cascade, 10s) → Full (all + impact scan, 45s)
- **Cascading Router:** REPO → WEB → HISTORY, stop early on high confidence
- **Enforcement Levels:** Advisory (log) → Gatekeeper (block if missing) → Mandatory (block if fails/low confidence)
- **Impact Scan Subagent:** Parallel execution with full grounding at DELIVER phase
- **Inline Grounding Triggers:** Explicit execution steps at phase transitions (finder/Grep/web_search with confidence calculation and enforcement behavior)
