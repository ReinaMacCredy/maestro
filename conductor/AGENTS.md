## Commands

- `bd compact --analyze --json` - Find beads needing summaries
- `bd compact --apply --id <id> --summary "<text>"` - Apply AI summary to bead
- `bd count --status closed --json` - Count closed beads for cleanup threshold
- `bd cleanup --older-than 0 --limit <n> --force` - Remove oldest closed beads

## Gotchas

- Delete operations must wait for reference replacements - deleting too early causes broken references
- Phase 3 (Knowledge Merge) is required - if it fails, stop workflow
- Phases 1 & 2 are best-effort - failures should log warnings but continue

## Patterns

- **4-Phase Workflow:** Thread Compaction → Beads Compaction → Knowledge Merge → Archive
- **Smart Skip:** Each phase checks if work exists before running
- **Resume Capability:** State files track progress for interrupted workflows
- **S/H/K Archive Choice:** Soft (metadata only) / Hard (move to archive/) / Keep (stay active)
