## Commands

- `tail -n +N file` - Strip first N-1 lines (useful for removing YAML frontmatter)
- `rm -rf skills/X .claude/skills/X` - Delete both hard-linked paths when removing skills

## Gotchas

- `skills/` and `.claude/skills/` are hard-linked (same inode) - updating one updates both, but delete both for cleanliness
- Thin skill stubs must include keyword-rich descriptions for AI trigger matching
- When moving reference files, strip YAML frontmatter to avoid duplicate metadata

## Patterns

- **Thin Skill + Workflow**: ~30 line skill stub with Entry Points table delegating to `workflows/<skill>/` directory
- **UPPERCASE references**: Supporting docs in `references/` use UPPERCASE (FILE_BEADS.md), main entry uses lowercase (workflow.md)
- **Parallel subagents for doc updates**: Independent file updates can be batched across 3+ subagents
