# Learnings: docs-rewrite_20260101

<!-- Auto-generated by /conductor-finish -->

## Commands

- `bd close <id> --reason skipped` - Use when file doesn't exist or task is not needed
- `wc -l *.md docs/*.md` - Line count verification across multiple directories
- `rg "pattern" *.md docs/*.md` - Stale reference check for deprecated skills

## Gotchas

- Missing files should use `--reason skipped`, not `--reason blocked`
- Stale references to deprecated skills (file-beads, review-beads) may exist in historical examples
- After merging and deleting docs, internal links will break - run link validation
- Code blocks with `# comments` may be incorrectly parsed as H1 headings by some validators

## Patterns

- **Parallel doc rewrites**: Independent doc files can be rewritten in parallel via Task tool
- **Aggressive trimming**: Strict line limits (100/150/500) force concise documentation
- **Externalizing dependencies**: Point to external plugins (superpowers) rather than removing references
