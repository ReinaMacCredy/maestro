# Learnings: auto-continuity

<!-- Auto-generated by /conductor-finish -->

## Commands

- `bd dep add <task> <epic>` - Wire dependencies after bead creation
- `bd ready --json` - List beads ready to work on
- `finder` - Locate all documentation referencing patterns

## Gotchas

- Continuity skill is in marketplace plugin, not local `skills/` directory - can't add direct dependency checks in local skill files
- Session start detection without hooks requires **implicit trigger** (maestro-core loading on first message)
- Manual continuity commands were documented in multiple places (GLOBAL_CONFIG.md, AGENTS.md, amp-setup.md) - all needed updating

## Patterns

- **Layered Auto-Load:** AGENTS.md → maestro-core → Conductor → ledger operations (defense in depth)
- **Workflow-Aware Continuity:** Tied to entry points (`ds`, `/conductor-implement`, `/conductor-finish`) not generic session events
- **Conductor-Only Continuity:** Ad-hoc tasks skip ledger operations (no overhead for trivial work)
