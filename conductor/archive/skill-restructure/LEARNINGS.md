# Learnings: skill-restructure

<!-- Auto-generated by /conductor-finish -->

## Commands

- `ln -s ../skills .claude/skills` - Create symlink for single source of truth
- `python3 skills/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py skills/<name>` - Validate skill structure and frontmatter
- `wc -l skills/*/SKILL.md` - Check line counts across all skills

## Gotchas

- Metadata status desync: `metadata.json.beads.status` can be stale compared to actual bead existence
- Symlink creation: Must delete `skills/` contents first before creating symlink
- Hard-linked vs symlinked: skills/ and skills/ share content - updating one updates both

## Patterns

- **Hub-and-Spoke Architecture:** maestro-core as central router (~62 lines), all spokes <100 lines
- **5-Level Skill Hierarchy:** conductor (1) > orchestrator (2) > design (3) > beads (4) > specialized (5) - higher rank wins on conflicts
- **SKILL.md Template:** Frontmatter (name, description) → Core Principles → Quick Reference table → Anti-Patterns → Guidelines → Related sections
- **Reference Extraction:** Move detailed content (>100 lines) to references/ subdirectory, keep SKILL.md as concise router
- **Bidirectional Related Links:** Each skill links to related skills; related skills link back for discoverability
- **Validation Before Merge:** Use quick_validate.py on each skill before considering complete
