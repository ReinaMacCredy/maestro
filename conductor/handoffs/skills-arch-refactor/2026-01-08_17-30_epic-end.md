# Handoff: skills-arch-refactor

**Trigger:** epic-end  
**Created:** 2026-01-08 17:30  
**Track:** skills-arch-refactor

## Status

✅ **EPIC COMPLETE** - All 10 tasks executed across 4 waves

## Summary

Executed Skills Architecture Refactor via orchestration:
- **Wave 1:** T1 (maestro-core routing) ✅
- **Wave 2:** T2, T3, T4, T5 (renames + merge) ✅ parallel
- **Wave 3:** T6, T7 (commands + flatten refs) ✅ parallel
- **Wave 4:** T8, T9, T10 (cross-refs + docs) ✅ parallel

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| design → designing | Gerund naming per Anthropic best practices |
| beads → tracking | Emphasize persistent memory for AI agents |
| skill-creator + writing-skills → creating-skills | Eliminate overlap |
| conductor owns ci only | Clear separation of concerns |
| designing owns ds, cn, phases 1-8 | Single owner for design workflow |
| handoff owns /conductor-finish | Session lifecycle together |

## Files Changed

185 files changed across:
- `skills/designing/` (renamed from design/)
- `skills/tracking/` (renamed from beads/)
- `skills/creating-skills/` (merged)
- `skills/conductor/` (trimmed)
- `skills/maestro-core/` (updated routing)
- `conductor/CODEMAPS/`
- `AGENTS.md`, `conductor/AGENTS.md`

## Final Skill Structure

```
skills/
├── conductor/       (ci only)
├── creating-skills/ (merged)
├── designing/       (ds, cn, phases 1-8)
├── handoff/         (ho, finish)
├── maestro-core/    (router)
├── orchestrator/    (co, parallel)
├── sharing-skills/
├── tracking/        (bd, fb, rb)
└── using-git-worktrees/
```

## Verification

- ✅ All SKILL.md files ≤500 lines (max: 222)
- ✅ Cross-skill references updated
- ✅ CODEMAPS accurate
- ✅ AGENTS.md consistent
- ✅ Git committed: `a3814c7`

## Next Steps

1. Run `/conductor-finish skills-arch-refactor` to archive track
2. Test triggers: `ds`, `ci`, `co`, `bd`, `ho`
3. Follow-up tracks (out of scope):
   - Agent Mail coordination simplification
   - Validation gate complexity reduction

## Beads State

- Epic: `my-workflow:3-3kay` (closed)
- All 10 child tasks closed
