# Skill Types

## Technique

Concrete method with steps to follow (condition-based-waiting, root-cause-tracing)

**Examples:** condition-based-waiting, root-cause-tracing, systematic-debugging

**Test with:**
- Recognition scenarios: Do they recognize when technique applies?
- Application scenarios: Can they follow the steps?
- Pressure scenarios: Will they use technique under pressure?

**Success criteria:** Agent correctly applies technique in novel scenarios

## Pattern

Way of thinking about problems (flatten-with-flags, test-invariants)

**Examples:** reducing-complexity, information-hiding concepts

**Test with:**
- Recognition scenarios: Do they recognize when pattern applies?
- Application scenarios: Can they use the mental model?
- Counter-examples: Do they know when NOT to apply?

**Success criteria:** Agent correctly identifies when/how to apply pattern

## Reference

API docs, syntax guides, tool documentation (office docs)

**Examples:** API documentation, command references, library guides

**Test with:**
- Retrieval scenarios: Can they find the right information?
- Application scenarios: Can they use what they found correctly?
- Gap testing: Are common use cases covered?

**Success criteria:** Agent finds and correctly applies reference information
