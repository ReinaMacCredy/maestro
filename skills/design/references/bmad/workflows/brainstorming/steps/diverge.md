# Diverge Phase

## Purpose
Generate maximum quantity of ideas without judgment.

## Rules
1. **Defer Judgment** - No criticism, no "but..."
2. **Go for Quantity** - More ideas = more options
3. **Welcome Wild Ideas** - Crazy leads to creative
4. **Build on Others** - "Yes, and..."
5. **Stay Focused** - On the topic, not tangents

## Process

### 1. Warm-up (2 min)
- Quick unrelated prompt to activate creative thinking
- Example: "Name 5 uses for a paperclip other than holding paper"

### 2. Idea Generation (10-15 min)
Apply selected method to generate ideas:

```markdown
## 💡 Ideas

1. [Idea]
2. [Idea]
3. [Idea]
...
```

### 3. Piggyback Round (5 min)
Review ideas and add variations:
- "What if we combined X and Y?"
- "How about the opposite of Z?"
- "What's the extreme version of W?"

## Output Format

```markdown
