# Cluster Phase

## Purpose
Organize ideas into meaningful groups to identify patterns and themes.

## Process

### 1. Review All Ideas
- Read through complete list
- Identify obvious duplicates

### 2. Identify Themes
Look for natural groupings:
- Similar concepts
- Related features
- Common approaches
- Shared goals

### 3. Create Clusters

```markdown
## 🗂️ Clusters

### Theme 1: [Name]
- [Idea A]
- [Idea B]
- [Idea C]

### Theme 2: [Name]
- [Idea D]
- [Idea E]

### Theme 3: [Name]
- [Idea F]
- [Idea G]
- [Idea H]

### Uncategorized
- [Ideas that don't fit elsewhere]
```

## Clustering Guidelines

| Guideline | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **3-7 Themes** | Aim for this range; fewer is too broad, more is fragmented |
| **3+ Ideas/Theme** | Themes with <3 ideas may need merging |
| **Descriptive Names** | Theme names should capture essence |
| **Allow Overlap** | Ideas can belong to multiple themes |

## Affinity Mapping Tips
- Start with largest/clearest clusters
- Name clusters after grouping, not before
- "Outliers" cluster is okay
- Combine small clusters if similar

## Output Format

```markdown
## Cluster Summary

| Theme | # Ideas | Key Insight |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| [Theme 1] | [n] | [What this group represents] |
| [Theme 2] | [n] | [What this group represents] |
| [Theme 3] | [n] | [What this group represents] |

**Patterns Observed:**
- [Pattern 1]
- [Pattern 2]
