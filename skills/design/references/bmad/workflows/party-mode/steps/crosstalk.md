# Cross-talk Patterns

## Purpose
Enable agents to react to each other's perspectives, creating richer insights through dialogue.

## Round Structure

### Round 1: Initial Reactions
Each agent responds to the others' key points:

```markdown
**[Agent A] → [Agent B]:**
"[Reaction to Agent B's perspective]"

**[Agent B] → [Agent C]:**
"[Reaction to Agent C's perspective]"

**[Agent C] → [Agent A]:**
"[Reaction to Agent A's perspective]"
```

### Round 2: Resolution (if needed)
Address remaining disagreements or build on agreements:

```markdown
**[Agent A]:** "[Refined position after hearing others]"
**[Agent B]:** "[Refined position after hearing others]"
**[Agent C]:** "[Refined position after hearing others]"
```

## Interaction Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Agreement** | Build on another's point | "I agree with [Agent], and would add that..." |
| **Challenge** | Respectfully disagree | "However, from a [X] perspective, I see..." |
| **Question** | Seek clarification | "[Agent], what do you think about...?" |
| **Synthesis** | Combine perspectives | "Combining [A]'s and [B]'s points..." |

## Constraints
- Maximum 2 rounds of cross-talk
- Each agent speaks once per round
- Focus on constructive dialogue
- Avoid repetition of original points
