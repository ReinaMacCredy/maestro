# Design Session (ds)

Turn ideas into fully-formed designs through collaborative dialogue using the Double Diamond methodology.

## When To Use

Trigger on:

- User types `ds`
- User runs `/conductor-design`
- User wants to brainstorm or explore an idea
- User says "design a feature" or "let's think through X"
- Before creating a conductor track

## Session Initialization

When starting a design session:

### 1. Load CODEMAPS for Context

Check for `conductor/CODEMAPS/` directory:

**If exists:**

1. Load `overview.md` (always)
2. Load relevant module codemaps based on topic (skills.md, api.md, etc.)
3. Display: `📚 Loaded CODEMAPS for context`

**If missing:**

1. Display: `⚠️ No CODEMAPS found. Run /conductor-setup to generate initial CODEMAPS.`
2. Continue session normally (CODEMAPS are optional but recommended)

### 2. Verify Conductor Setup

Check for `conductor/` directory with core files:

- `product.md` - Product vision
- `tech-stack.md` - Technical constraints
- `workflow.md` - Development standards

If missing, suggest: `Run /conductor-setup first for full context.`

## Double Diamond Framework

The session flows through four phases, alternating between divergent and convergent thinking:

## The Process

### Phase 1: DISCOVER (Diverge)

**Goal:** Understand the problem deeply before jumping to solutions.

- Explore the problem space broadly
- Ask about pain points, users, impact, constraints
- One question at a time, prefer multiple choice
- **Exit:** Problem clearly articulated, users identified

### Phase 2: DEFINE (Converge)

**Goal:** Synthesize discoveries into a clear problem statement.

- Create a one-sentence problem statement
- Define success criteria (measurable)
- Bound the scope (in/out)
- Present 2-3 approaches with trade-offs
- **Exit:** Problem statement agreed, approach selected

### Phase 3: DEVELOP (Diverge)

**Goal:** Design the solution architecture and components.

- Present design in 200-300 word sections
- Cover: architecture, components, data model, user flow, errors, testing
- Ask after each section: "Does this look right so far?"
- Be ready to revise earlier sections
- **Exit:** Architecture understood, components defined

### Phase 4: DELIVER (Converge)

**Goal:** Finalize the design and prepare for implementation.

- **Full Grounding (required)** - verify against codebase and current docs
- Ensure acceptance criteria are testable
- Document risks and open questions
- **Exit:** Design verified and approved

## A/P/C Checkpoints

At the end of each phase, present the checkpoint menu:

```
📍 End of [PHASE] phase.

Choose:
[A] Advanced - deeper analysis, assumption audit
[P] Party - multi-perspective feedback from expert agents
[C] Continue - proceed to next phase
[↩ Back] - return to previous phase
```

### [A] Advanced Mode

Phase-specific deep dives:

- **DISCOVER:** Challenge assumptions, explore biases, consider alternative users
- **DEFINE:** Stress-test scope, challenge metrics, identify hidden dependencies
- **DEVELOP:** Deep-dive components, explore alternatives, security/performance review
- **DELIVER:** Edge case audit, security check, documentation completeness

### [P] Party Mode

Invokes multi-agent collaborative review. See `workflows/party-mode/workflow.md`.

Selects 3 relevant agents based on topic:

- **Primary:** Best expertise match
- **Secondary:** Complementary perspective
- **Tertiary:** Devil's advocate

Agents respond in character, cross-talk, then synthesize insights.

## Loop-Back Support

User can say "revisit [PHASE]" at any time to return to an earlier phase. When looping back:

1. Summarize what was established
2. Ask what to reconsider
3. Update subsequent phases if decisions change

## Grounding Requirements

**Mini-grounding** at each phase transition:

- DISCOVER → DEFINE: Check for similar problems in codebase
- DEFINE → DEVELOP: Verify external APIs/libraries
- DEVELOP → DELIVER: Confirm existing patterns and conventions

**Full grounding** before DELIVER completion:

- Verify all architectural decisions against current reality
- Use `web_search`, `Grep`, `finder`, `git log`
- Do NOT proceed to documentation without grounding

## After the Design

### Review and Handoff

1. Ask: "Review the design?"
2. Address any feedback
3. When approved, say: **"Design approved. Run `/conductor-newtrack {track_id}` to generate spec, plan, and file beads."**

If a track doesn't exist yet, suggest running `/conductor-newtrack <description>` first.

For the full implementation workflow after design, see `skills/conductor/SKILL.md`.

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches
- **Incremental validation** - Present in sections, validate each
- **Be flexible** - Go back when something doesn't make sense
- **Ground everything** - Verify before finalizing
