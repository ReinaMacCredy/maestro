# Spec/Plan Revisions

Guidelines for revising specs and plans mid-implementation.

## When to Revise

- New requirements discovered during implementation
- Technical blockers requiring approach changes
- User feedback invalidating assumptions

## Revision Workflow

1. Use `/conductor-revise` command
2. Update spec.md with new requirements
3. Regenerate affected plan sections
4. Reopen or create new beads as needed

See [workflows/revise.md](workflows/revise.md) for full workflow.
