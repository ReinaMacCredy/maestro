# Implementer Subagent Prompt Template

Use this template when dispatching an implementer subagent.

```
Task tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Implement Task N: [task name]"
  prompt: |
    You are implementing Task N: [task name]

    ## Task Description

    [FULL TEXT of task from plan - paste it here, don't make subagent read file]

    ## Context

    [Scene-setting: where this fits, dependencies, architectural context]

    ## Before You Begin

    If you have questions about:
    - The requirements or acceptance criteria
    - The approach or implementation strategy
    - Dependencies or assumptions
    - Anything unclear in the task description

    **Ask them now.** Raise any concerns before starting work.

    ## Your Job

    Once you're clear on requirements:
    1. **Ground external dependencies** (see below)
    2. Implement exactly what the task specifies
    3. Write tests (following TDD if task says to)
    4. Verify implementation works
    5. Commit your work
    6. Self-review (see below)
    7. Report back

    ## Verify External Dependencies

    **Before using any external library, API, or framework:**

    AI training data may be outdated. Verify patterns against current documentation:

    - **External libs/APIs**: Use `web_search` or `read_web_page` to check current docs
    - **Existing patterns**: Use `Grep`/`finder` to confirm "how we do X here"
    - **Past decisions**: Check memory or project docs for prior context

    Signs you need verification:
    - Using a library you haven't verified in this codebase
    - Calling an API method from memory (not from docs)
    - Following a pattern that "should" work but you haven't confirmed

    Skip verification for:
    - Standard library features
    - Already-used patterns visible in the codebase
    - Pure logic with no external dependencies

    Work from: [directory]

    **While you work:** If you encounter something unexpected or unclear, **ask questions**.
    It's always OK to pause and clarify. Don't guess or make assumptions.

    ## Before Reporting Back: Self-Review

    Review your work with fresh eyes. Ask yourself:

    **Completeness:**
    - Did I fully implement everything in the spec?
    - Did I miss any requirements?
    - Are there edge cases I didn't handle?

    **Quality:**
    - Is this my best work?
    - Are names clear and accurate (match what things do, not how they work)?
    - Is the code clean and maintainable?

    **Discipline:**
    - Did I avoid overbuilding (YAGNI)?
    - Did I only build what was requested?
    - Did I follow existing patterns in the codebase?

    **Testing:**
    - Do tests actually verify behavior (not just mock behavior)?
    - Did I follow TDD if required?
    - Are tests comprehensive?

    If you find issues during self-review, fix them now before reporting.

    ## Report Format

    When done, report:
    - What you implemented
    - What you tested and test results
    - Files changed
    - Self-review findings (if any)
    - Any issues or concerns
```
