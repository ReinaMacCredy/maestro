# Narrative Frameworks & Techniques

## Core Narrative Principles

### Show, Don't Tell
Replace abstract statements with concrete scenes.

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| "The user was frustrated" | "She clicked the back button for the third time, then closed her laptop" |
| "The product is fast" | "Before she finished her coffee, the report was done" |
| "Customers love us" | "'I can't imagine going back,' Maria says" |

### Specificity Creates Believability
The more specific, the more real.

- ❌ "A customer in retail"
- ✅ "Sarah, a floor manager at a Whole Foods in Austin"

### Emotion Through Character
People don't connect with products. They connect with people using products.

## Character Development

### The Character Sketch Template

```markdown
**Name:** [Specific name]
**Role:** [Job title, context]
**Goal:** [What they want]
**Obstacle:** [What's in their way]
**Stakes:** [What happens if they fail]
**Quirk:** [Humanizing detail]
```

### Character Types in Product Stories

| Type | Role | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| **The Struggler** | Shows the problem | User drowning in manual work |
| **The Skeptic** | Raises objections | "We tried tools before, they never work" |
| **The Champion** | Advocates internally | Manager who pushes for adoption |
| **The Transformer** | Shows change | User who went from struggling to thriving |

## Tension & Conflict Techniques

### Types of Conflict

1. **Person vs. System** - Bureaucracy, legacy tools, processes
2. **Person vs. Time** - Deadlines, competition, growth
3. **Person vs. Self** - Doubt, fear of change, skills gap
4. **Person vs. Environment** - Market shifts, industry disruption

### Building Tension

1. **Raise the stakes** - What else could go wrong?
2. **Add time pressure** - When is the deadline?
3. **Create obstacles** - What's blocking progress?
4. **Show consequences** - What happens if they fail?

## Emotional Resonance

### Universal Emotional Triggers

| Emotion | Trigger |
|---------|---------|
| **Fear** | Uncertainty, risk, loss |
| **Hope** | Possibility, future, potential |
| **Frustration** | Barriers, inefficiency, waste |
| **Pride** | Achievement, recognition, mastery |
| **Belonging** | Community, shared experience |
| **Relief** | Problem solved, burden lifted |

### The Emotional Arc

```
Struggle → Doubt → Discovery → Effort → Breakthrough → Transformation
```

## Voice & Tone Techniques

### Finding Authentic Voice

- Use actual quotes from users
- Match vocabulary to audience
- Avoid jargon unless audience expects it
- Read aloud to check naturalness

### Tone Spectrum

| Context | Tone |
|---------|------|
| Crisis/urgency | Direct, action-oriented |
| Inspiration | Aspirational, warm |
| Technical | Precise, confident |
| Community | Inclusive, collaborative |

## Scene Construction

### The SCENE Framework

- **Setting**: Where and when
- **Character**: Who is present
- **Event**: What happens
- **Need**: What the character wants
- **Emotion**: How they feel

### Scene Beats

Each scene should have:
1. **Entry point** - How we arrive
2. **Tension** - What's at stake
3. **Turn** - Something changes
4. **Exit** - New state or question

## Dialogue Techniques

### Making Dialogue Real

- Use incomplete sentences
- Include interruptions
- Add verbal tics ("I mean...", "So...")
- Keep exchanges short

### Dialogue Functions

| Function | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Reveal character** | "I've tried everything. Nothing works." |
| **Advance plot** | "Wait—what if we tried it this way?" |
| **Create tension** | "The board meeting is in an hour." |
| **Provide information** | "The API went down three times last week." |

## Metaphor & Analogy

### Effective Analogies

Connect unfamiliar to familiar:

| Abstract Concept | Concrete Analogy |
|------------------|------------------|
| Technical debt | Clutter in a garage |
| Data pipeline | Water plumbing |
| API integration | Translator between languages |
| User journey | Road trip with stops |

### Metaphor Patterns

- **Journey**: "The path to...", "milestone", "roadblock"
- **Building**: "foundation", "architecture", "scaffolding"
- **Growth**: "nurture", "cultivate", "harvest"
- **Battle**: "strategy", "defense", "victory"

---

## Narrative Transitions

### Connecting Scenes

| Transition | Usage |
|------------|-------|
| **Meanwhile** | Parallel action |
| **Three weeks later** | Time jump |
| **What she didn't know** | Dramatic irony |
| **That's when everything changed** | Turning point |

### The Bridge Sentence

End one section with a question or tension that the next section answers.

> "She thought the worst was behind her." [Next section reveals it wasn't]

---

## Endings That Resonate

### Strong Ending Types

1. **The Circle** - Return to opening image, transformed
2. **The Future Glimpse** - Show what's next
3. **The Reflection** - Character's insight
4. **The Call to Action** - Invite the audience to act
5. **The Echo** - Repeat key phrase with new meaning

### The Final Beat

Leave the audience with:
- An emotion to feel
- An action to take
- A question to ponder
- An image to remember
