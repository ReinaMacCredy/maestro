# Product Guidelines

## Voice & Tone
Professional and direct. Clear, concise, no fluff. Suitable for developer tools and AI workflow automation.

## UX Principles
- Zero-config defaults: work out of the box; power users can customize
- Progressive disclosure: show only what's needed; reveal complexity on demand
- Prescriptive instructions: commands say "You MUST do X", not "What Happens"

## Branding
No branding constraints defined.

## Writing Style
- Use active voice.
- Prefer short sentences (under 20 words).
- Error messages: state what happened, why, and how to fix it.
- Use plain text markers: `[!]` `[ok]` `-->` `[x]` -- no emoji.
