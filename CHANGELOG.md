# Changelog

All notable changes to Maestro are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## Unreleased history

The 0.107.x series was the Rust implementation. Version 0.108.0 begins the
TypeScript-on-Bun line and continues the existing version sequence.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `scripts/install.sh`: one-command source install
  (`curl -fsSL .../scripts/install.sh | sh`) that clones the repository into
  `~/.maestro/source` and runs the installer from it, so `maestro update`
  keeps following that checkout.

## [0.108.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- Rebuilt Maestro in TypeScript on Bun around a mechanism-only kernel, removable
  verb and policy plugins, and prompt-first Markdown recipes and skills.
- Added durable work, decisions, bundles, dispatches, handbacks, councils,
  attention packets, observer mode, a cross-repository brief, and the
  Supervisor, Lead, and Peer role model.
- Added source-checkout installation, fast-forward-only updates, read-only
  diagnostics, repository uninstall, a private Supervisor room, and four
  installed method skills.
- Added a bounded stdio MCP interface for finding and running Maestro verbs.
- Added read-only import of Rust-era stores plus idempotent promotion of legacy
  work, decisions, supersession links, receipts, and archived snapshots.

### Changed

- Coordination lanes now use Herdr panes for agent lifecycle and wake-up while
  Maestro remains the durable contract and evidence record.
- Attention is computed when read instead of delivered through a daemon or
  mailbox. Returned but unreviewed handbacks now receive immediate attention.
- The Rust-era stores are preserved under `legacy/rust/` for import and
  provenance.

### Fixed

- Serialized store transitions and ID allocation so concurrent work, decision,
  and dispatch operations cannot lose leases, collide IDs, or leak raw SQLite
  errors.
- Scoped council membership to the current concurrent generation and applied
  decision supersession only when the replacement locks.
- Rejected blank required arguments and invalid lane names with actionable
  errors.
- Hardened installer source trust, symlink boundaries, configuration writes,
  file permissions, rollback behavior, and runtime restamping.
- Made observer search fail closed when its index cannot be refreshed.
- Validated malformed MCP frames without terminating the server.
- Preserved native chronology and evidence when Rust data is promoted, including
  repeated promotion and missing-receipt handling.
- Corrected lane session resolution, handback status guidance, and command
  contracts in generated documentation.
