# Changelog

## 1.0.0 — Phase 1 strip

This release is the v1 cutover to the conductor model. Maestro is no longer a
harness that spawns workers; it is a shared mission/memory artifact that
external workers (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, etc.) read from and write to
via the CLI. The worker-execution layer has been removed wholesale, which is
why Phase 1 ships as a major bump.

### Removed CLI subcommands

- `maestro feature run` (the sequential feature execution engine)
- `maestro handoff`
- `maestro handoff-pickup`
- `maestro handoff-dig`
- `maestro handoff-drop`
- `maestro handoff-cleanup`
- `maestro handoff-report`
- `maestro a2a` (agent-to-agent debug command)

Phase 2 will re-introduce a single `maestro handoff` command that produces
UKI v5.2 format records; this 1.0.0 release intentionally has no handoff
surface at all.

### Removed ports and adapters

- `TransportPort` (`cli-transport`, `a2a-transport`, `multi-transport`)
- `RuntimeStorePort` / `RuntimeEventStorePort` (worker runtime + event stores)
- `ExecutionStorePort` (historic execution records)
- `HandoffStorePort` and `HandoffEnvelope` / `HandoffSession` / `HandoffPlan`
  / `Handoff` domain types (Phase 2 will re-introduce a `HandoffStorePort`
  with a completely different shape keyed on UKI records)
- `CassPort` and all CASS knowledge-store integration
- Runtime supervision stack: `runtime-supervision.usecase`,
  `runtime-recovery.usecase`, `live-runtime-tracking.usecase`
- Worker dispatch: `run-features.usecase`
- Handoff use-cases: `create-handoff`, `pickup-handoff`, `dig-handoff`,
  `report-handoff`, plus the orphaned `generate-prompt` usecase that only
  wrapped the deleted `handoff-pickup --claim` workflow

### Behavior changes

- `feature-lifecycle.updateFeature` no longer writes to a runtime store.
  Feature status updates now touch the feature store only; the runtime
  lease / last-seen / failure-reason fields are gone because there is no
  runtime to supervise.
- `session-detect` simplified: the cwd-fallback, session-id prefix resolve,
  and staleness warning flows are gone. The adapter only reads
  `CLAUDECODE` / `CODEX_THREAD_ID` env vars. Explicit `--session <id>`
  arguments are required wherever a session must be identified outside of
  those two environments.
- `generate-worker-prompt.usecase` no longer takes a `runtimeStore`
  parameter. The memory-injection path (`safeRecallMemory` ->
  `appendMemorySection`) is unchanged and continues to auto-wire into
  `maestro feature prompt <id>`.
- Mission Control worker / runtime / output panes are empty until Phase 3
  removes them outright. The dashboard, features, dependencies, config,
  memory, handoffs, and graph screens remain fully functional.
- Top-level CLI description changed from "Cross-agent handoff CLI" to
  "Conductor CLI".

### Removed devDependencies

- `@a2a-js/sdk`
- `express` and `@types/express`

These shipped only to support the now-deleted A2A transport.

### Upgrade notes

- Existing `.maestro/handoffs/` records are orphaned by this release. There
  is no migration path; they will be re-formatted by Phase 2 when the UKI
  handoff store ships.
- Any scripts that shell out to `maestro feature run`, `maestro handoff *`,
  or `maestro a2a *` must be updated. Use `maestro feature prompt <id>` to
  generate a worker prompt, then run the actual worker in a separate
  terminal (Claude Code, Codex, etc.).
